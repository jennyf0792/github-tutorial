This is where you first begin to place your SSH key from the device you're using (nitrous, cloud 9, etc)\r\ninto Github so that viewers can see it live.\r\n\r\n**Directions:** \r\n\r\n1. sign in with github and the local machine you are using\r\n2. once signed in, continue on by clicking on settings on the dropdown menu with your profile icon\r\n3. select \"SSH keys\" and press \"add key\"\r\n4. name the key and copy and paste your SSH key into the large text box \r\n  * title must be the same as the one you named in your device you're working with\r\n  * similar to finding the previous steps; go to your local machine > settings > SSH Keys > copy and paste the default key\r\n5. after you've added the key, you are able to run your code through github so that others can preview live of your workflow\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\n\r\nIn order to create a repositories, you must name your repo to something that is relavant to what your code presents.  \r\n\r\n#####For GitHub\r\n\r\n1. Sign into github.com and your local machine, that may be Nitrous, Cloud 9, etc\r\n2. On github.com, travel to your profile and select on 'repositories' and click on \"New\"\r\n3. Type in the **EXACT** name that you typed into your local machine\r\n * otherwise, it would not work and would not connect to your repository \r\n4. Then press, \"Create Repository\"\r\n\r\n#####For Your Local Machine\r\n\r\n1. Sign into your device that you are working with\r\n2. Press on new workspace to add a new repo\r\n3. Type a title that is simple and easy to recall\r\n4. Then just press \"Create Workspace\"\r\n \r\nAnd you are done! Well, continue creating repositories if you desire to add more\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of commands that you can run through the local machine you are operating with\r\n\r\n_Here are a list of the relatively significant command lines that you'll use on your device_\r\n\r\n * **git init** - this can initialize and start your local machine\r\n  * without this, you can use anything else below the list\r\n * **git status** - this allows you to see what commits, adds, or changes you've made and what you need to do to save your changes\r\n * **pwd** - basically assists you acknowledge where you are exactly\r\n  * if you type in pwd and you get back '/home/ubuntu/workspace/github-tutorial' and you are meant to be in your 'about-me' then _'cd ..'_out \r\n * **ls** - this will list the items your repositories contain\r\n  * example: \r\n  You are in github-learning and type into the workspace, ls, and you get back\r\n    \"directions.md' & 'README.md'\r\n * **git add README.md** - this command line will add the file that you had just made changes to\r\n * **git commit -m \" \"** - save a snapshot of your code that you have just added\r\n * **cd ..** - allows you get out the repositories and return to where you were before\r\n * **git log** - you can see your past commits\r\n * **git diff** - (self-explanatory) able to view the difference between your current code and the previous commit\r\n * **git remote add origin URL** - you can connect your URL to the location of your remote repo (short for repositories)\r\n  * select SSH because you've added an SSH key to your github.com account\r\n * **git push -u origin master** - you are able to send your commits from your local repo to your remote repo\r\n * **git pull** - takes any changes from the remote repo to local repo\r\n * **git clone URL** - will copy the code/repositories that you want to adjust for your own changes\r\n\r\n **_Forking_** obtains a remote copy of someone else's remote repo\r\n * you DO have consent to push your changes to the original repo  \r\n * _remote repositories_ refers to other repository that consists a variety of protocols such as HTTP://, SSH:// \r\n\r\n **_Cloning_** copies of the local remote(s) of someone else's remote repo\r\n * you are not able to push any changes into the original remote repository  \r\n * _local repositories_ are a copy of your own equipment that holds your remote downloads","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
